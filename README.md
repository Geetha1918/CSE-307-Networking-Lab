CA Assignment 
You are hired as a network engineer for Hybrid
Infotech Ltd., a mid-sized enterprise with a 7-floor office building.
Each floor is equipped with 7 computers, and the organization
requires a well-structured network to ensure efficient communication
and scalability.
Network Design Requirements:
1. Topology Selection: Design a ring topology for 2 floors, a mesh
topology for the 3 floors, and then a star topology for 2 floors,
considering performance and fault tolerance.
2. IP Addressing Scheme: The company has decided to use Class B
public IPv4 addresses following a classful addressing scheme.
Allocate IP addresses properly for each floor, ensuring uniqueness.
3. Routing Strategy for Inter-Floor Communication &
Connectivity: Recommend a routing approach that is dynamic for
inter-floor communication.
 Design how the floors will be connected for seamless inter-
department communication.
 Suggest the appropriate network devices (e.g., switches,
routers, access points) and their placement.
 If using dynamic routing, suggest an appropriate routing
protocol (e.g., RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP) with justification.
 If using static routing, define the static routes for efficient data
flow.
 Specify the number of default gateways along with IP
addresses.
